# Assignment

##Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts).
We looked at different ways to generate [pseudo-random numbers]
* **(a) - 3pts:** Output the results of five different random number engines, using a uniform distribution for values between [0-100]. Generate useful charts and statistics from the output to analyze how uniform these values truly are. You are expected to look at some advanced statistics and test, for example: tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, Autocorrelation test, and Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation Coefficient are a few examples of ones your could use.)

~~~
ANS:
I essentially just commented out code in random.cpp from Discreet2, 
keeping the uniform_real_distribution for all random number generator
engines. The first random number generator (RNG) I used was mt19937_64, 
followed by knuth_b, minstd_rand, and ranlux48, and sobol.  I 
copied the data into separate text files, and then plotted the 
data in excel (See Graphs Below).  Additionally using excel, 
I ran the Chi-square Test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test.

I utilized the Chi-Square Test function in Excel to obtain the 
results below. Degrees of freedom are found by taking Rows-1 *
Columns-1, so in this case the DF=100; however the function in 
excel takes this into consideration. 
The Chi-Square Test p values indicates that all values are lower
than .05, which means they are statistically significant, or that
the numbers are likely to some degree to be distributed uniformly 
and randomly. Additionally, MINISTD_RAND has the highest value, 
and MT has the lowest value; this likely means that MT is the most 
uniform for the random values.

I learned/utilized the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test in excel by watching 
a Youtube video (see references below). The Komogorov-Smirnov Test 
results are listed in the chart below; because all the largest 
differences (D) values (found by taking the difference between each 
distribution and the expected value, and then manually searching for 
the data) are greater than the critical D (formula: 1.36/SQRT(100000)), 
uniform random distribution is likely not happening, as the difference in
D values indicates that there are varying distributions.  If we had lower
D values than the critical D, it would indicate that there is not enough
evidence to conclude there's major discrepancies between 
the two distributions.  The RANLUX appears to be the RNG that is closest
to the critical D value, and is thus closer to distributing random values
equally.

* **(b) - 2pts:**  Vary *N* (amount of samples). How do things change.

~~~
ANS:
I simply changed the N number in the program for each
RNG listed above to 1000 and 1000000.  I noticed that in general, a more
distinct pattern emerged as N increased for all RNGs (see graphs below).
~~~

* **(c) - 3pts:** Fix a random engine of your choice from part (a), and now vary five different [distributions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) for just the psedo-random numbers. Again, analyze your results with graphs and statistics of choice.

~~~
ANS:
I picked the MT (Marsenne Twister) as it was suggested by Joe during office hours
due to its widespread use.  Using random.cpp in Discreet2, I utilized N = 100000, 
and then utilized the following distributions (all from 0,100): Uniform Real, Normal, Uniform Int, Chi-Squared, and Cauchy Distributions.  I found the code for Chi Squared
and Cauchy in Discreet2 under External Dependencies -> Random -> std.

NORMAL and CAUCHY NOT WORKING (producing weird and negative numbers), FISHER and 
WEIBULL and GAMMA NOT WORKING AT ALL

CAN I DO UNIFORM REAL AGAIN, OR PICK ANOTHER?  WANT TO COMPARE UNIFORM REAL AND
UNIFORM INT; WHAT DOES PSEUDO RANDOM NUMBERS MEAN IN THE QUESTION?  CAN I JUST
RUN THE PROGRAM?

Based on the data I acquired....X.  Please refer to the charts below.
~~~


* **(d)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different random number engines. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines.

~~~
ANS:
For this part of the problem, I utilized the uniform real distribution with a range
from 0-1 and N of 100000, and simply changed the RNGs.  I subsequently ran the RNGs
with Ns of 1000 and 1000000 for each individual RNG. The order of RNGs I used was mt19937, followed by knuth_b, minstd_rand, ranlux48, and sobolo (which I ran from quasi.cpp file). I then used the raw results from each and plotted via excel (see 
chart below).

CAN I JUST USE THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR TO SIMULATE X AND Y?  OR DO I SIMPLY
DECREASE N VALUES?

HOW DO WE CHANGE SOBOL RANGE FROM 0-1????  WENT THROUGH BOTH QUASI AND SOBOL AND 
COULDN"T FIND INPUT...
~~~

* **(e)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different distributions. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines. (See [Random Numbers Webcourse page](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1246518/pages/random-numbers?module_item_id=10541423) for a rough idea what you should produce.)

~~~
ANS:
Same issues with distributions...need to fix ASAP!
~~~

* **(f)- 4pts:** Repeat parts (d) and (e) with a unit circle.

~~~
ANS:
Same issue with SOBOL as above for part D, how to input -1,1 in that program

For differing distributions, need to check with Joe for if I'm doing them right

##Part 2 - Snakes and Ladders (Discrete Event Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulations) (30 pts)


* **(a) Null State Game transition matrix - 10pts:** The *null state game* is defined by a game with no snakes and no ladders. This simplifies the game to just the moves of the two dice rolls. Create the transition matrix for the null state game. 

~~~
ANS:
I used the code from class/piazza to create the transition matrix for the null state
game; also received help from William Netterville (see references below) .
~~~

* **(b) Simulate and analyze the results of Null State Game - 10pts:** What is the modal number of moves required by a single player to finish the game? Produce graphs to analyze the results and show how the game evolves over time for both methods. Plot useful statistics of the results such as percentage chance of finishing the game in n-moves, cumulative probability of finishing the game in n-moves, and other ways to convey useful information of the results.

~~~
ANS:
I used the code from class/piazza to create the transition matrix for the null state
game; also received help from William Netterville (see references below) .
~~~

* **(c) Simulate and analyze the results of Snakes and Ladders -10pts:**  Construct a new transition matrix based on the table:


Ladders From  | Ladders To | |  Snakes From  | Snakes To 
-------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- 
3|19| |11|7
15|37| |18|13
22|42| |28|12
25|64| |36|34
41|73| |77|16
53|74| |47|26
63|86| |83|39
76|91| |92|75
84|98| |99|70



Run the same simulation and analyze your results similar to part (b) for the proper game of *Snakes and Ladders* for both methods. How often are the snakes and ladders used, how do the probability of finishing change, etc? What is the maximum and expected amount of moves for the game? Use charts and graphs to illustrate these points.

~~~
ANS:
I used the code from class/piazza to create the transition matrix for the null state
game; also received help from William Netterville (see references below) .
~~~

* **(d) Think - 0pts:** If these games are built entirely on chance, do they require any strategy? Is it really a *game*, would you rather play games of chance or games of strategy?

~~~
ANS:
If the games are completely built on chance, by definition they do not require any
strategy, unless one was to know the engines/processes driving that chance, which to some degree all games are driven by.  Personally, I'd rather play a game of strategy
to have more control over the outcomes; skill or strategy games are generally determined by propensity of the individual to play, and also more importantly, their
devotion to practicing and thus becoming better at the game.  Therefore, to increase
my odds of winning through hard work/practice, I would choose a game of strategy.

##Part 3 - Discrete Event Simulation - Queue Simulation (30 pts)

This problem will look at queues and commonly used performance measures. For this problem we will look to design a simple airport security check. We will make the following assumptions: (1) there is only one airline - Southwest; (2) passengers' interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (IID) with an exponential distribution with mean 1 / lambda. The service times are also assumed to be IID and exponentially distributed random variables with mean 1 / mu.
<BR>![](images/queue.png?raw=true)<BR>
When a passanger arrives they have to wait in a queue to present their ID and ticket to the gate agent with all the other passengers. Once approved by the agent they will have to pass through a security check. Since this is Orlando, there are only 3 open metal/screening devices open and again passangers have to wait in a queue. After passing through security you again have to wait in a queue to board your plane.

* **(a) - 4pts:** To start create the senario in the figure above in *main.cpp*. Checkin will have a *mu* of 53 and accept new arrivals, the security gates will have a *mu* of 20, and will not accept new arrivials, boarding will have a *mu* of 80. You will have to set up  the appropriate *MM1_Queue* objects to capture the functionality above.


~~~
ANS: Please refer to coding in main.cpp.
~~~


* **(b) - 4pts:** You want to add a check that your process is within an error range *is_within_error_range(float)* where the error range will be 0.002. You also want to process the next event, and add an external arrival where marked.
* **(c) - 3pts:** in *mm1_queue.cpp* : add code to caculate the expected results for: 
  *  expected_server_utilization 
  *    expected idle prob
  *   expected queue length 
  *  expected number customers 
  * expected waiting time
  * expected response time 


~~~
ANS: Please refer to coding in main.cpp.
~~~


***(d) - 4pts:** Write code to call the functions to output and generate data from the airport senario. Plot and analyze the useful statistics/results in the program of your choice.  (Hint -  basically call  *.output();* on the MM1_Queue objects you create. Hint2 - two other use functions are *get_current_time()* and  *plot_results_output()* call intially on your intial MM1_Queue object.)

~~~
ANS: Please refer to coding in main.cpp.  
In regards to useful data and statistics, the following charts display
interesting statistics about the data I obtained.
~~~

***(e) - 15pts:** AnyLogic Simulation;

~~~
ANS:
- Note: I added AnyLogic files under the images folder 
in my repository for reference

Narrative of Construction:
To construct this simulation, I utilized the pedestrian library; all inputs were
left in default mode unless otherwise noted.  I first made a target line and a
ped source block.  I connected the ped source block to a Go To Block (referred
to as "GTCheckin"), and then emplaced a rectangular area to serve as the container
for pedestrians around a Wait block (named "CIwait"; inputted a delay of 53 minutes,  but for simulation changed to millisecs for quicker observation (repeated in next
wait areas as well)).  

From CIwait, I emplaced
a Go To block ("GTsecurity) and then a Wait block ("SecWait"; with a 20 min delay setting), followed by a Ped Select Output named "Security Queue", in which I only
connected 3 of the 5 outputs and put probabilities of all three at .333.  Following this, I emplaced another Go To block ("GTBoarding") and a Wait block ("BoardWait").

Finally, I emplaced a Go To block named "GTplane" and a Ped Sink named "End" to finish the simulation of pedestrians moving through airport security.

I then built the model and ran it; see below for screen shots displaying
this simulation.
