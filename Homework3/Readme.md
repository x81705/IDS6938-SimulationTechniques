# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to enable the behavioral animation of vehicle-like walking agents. 

You will be expected to compose a *final report* which demonstrates your understanding on the material in each section of the assignment. Be visual! - Pictures say a thousand words so you do not have to. Show off your different configurations and really explore the assignment.


### Part 2: Behaviors
In this part of the assignment you will need to implement 6 types of individual behaviors and 5 types of group behaviors. 
**(a)** : Create the following behaviors through appropriate computation of V<sub> d</sub>  and θ<sub>d</sub>  commands:
* Seek
* Flee
* Arrival
* Departure
* Wander
* Obstacle Avoidance

**(b)**: Implement the functions for the following group behaviors:
