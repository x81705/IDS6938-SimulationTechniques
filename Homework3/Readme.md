### Part 1: Behaviors

**(a) - 10 points** : Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. Implement the function *SIMAgent::FindDeriv()*. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called.

Description of agent state vector and input vector:  
* state[0] is the position of the agent in local body coordinates (almost useless in this project);  
* state[1] is the orientation angle of the agent with respect to world (i.e. global) coordinates;  
* state[2] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates.  
* state[3] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates. 
* input[0] is the force in local body coordinates;  
* input[1] is the torque in local body coordinates

You will need to set deriv[0], deriv[1], deriv[2], deriv[3]. Compute derivative vector given input and state vectors. This function sets derive vector to appropriate values after being called. 
* deriv[2] is the velocity of the agent  in local body coordinates
* deriv[3] is the angular velocity of the agent in world coordinates
* deriv[0] is the force in local body coordinates divided by the mass.

**(b) - 20 points**: Create a maze. Generate the pdm, stats, and animations like before. Vary [parameters in your agents](https://help.anylogic.com/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/_PL/reference/Attributes.html) to give them different behaviors and show the pedistrians change how they navigate the maze.
~~~
ANS: 
INTRODUCTION/ASSUMPTIONS/INIITAL CONDITIONS
This maze would replicate something similar to mazes commonly found in amusement parks around the globe.  There are two areas in which the agents can "see" dead ends and do not choose this path (see screenshot below); we are making the assumption that this maze is conducted in a medium light levels, and that agents will be able to generally see the path in front of them.  We will also assume that due to the difficulty of the maze, that after choosing a wrong path, agents will be redirected back to the decision point, and will then have an equal probability of choosing all paths.

Additionally, we will assume that this maze will replicate peak hours, with 5 agents arriving per minute (additionally, initial speed of .3 to .7 meters per second distributed uniformly, and a comfortable speed of 1 to 2 meters per second distributed unifromly, with no limit on agent number; will assume that the maze is very popular and that it is a weekend/federal holiday where the maximum traffic will occur). 

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAZE
I first searched via google for an image of a maze, and then imported it to AnyLogic (maze obtained from MIT.edu; see references below).  During initial probelm solving, I constructed the maze and populated it with agents, but realized that the agents were simply taking the path of least resistance to the exit, and not taking any dead-end turns.  I posted a question via Piazaa regarding this issue, and saw that other students had used the pedSelect node to work around this problem (MacArthur, Keith; see references below). I utilized this method of emplacing multiple pedSelect nodes (linked to target lines) to simulate agents choosing a path based on equal probability.

METHODOLOGY
To analyze the data and display stats, I added a pedestrian density map (which displays density of pedestrians in the simulated space via color representation, with blue being least dense and red being most dense), and also added timeplots for both traffic and intensity, in which traffic is the number of pedestrians crossing the ped flow statistics lines in an hour (model time), and intensity is defined as the traffic divided by the line length.  Both timeplots utilize one sample per second and display the totality of the data for each trial(3600 seconds).

I initially populated the maze with 5 agents per minute (leaving all other settings at default) and then ran the simulation ten times and recording the number of agents that exited the maze.

I then took screenshots every 1200 seconds (or every 20 minutes (+- 5 seconds), model time) to analyze the data, and ran the simulation ten times.  The screenshots below show the coalated data for each trial, with the intensity and traffic timeplots at the completion of each individual simulation.  The traffic density maps represent data from left to right at 1200, 2400, and the 3600 second model time.

ANALYSIS - Pedestrian Density Maps
To better understand the data, I then compared the pedestrian density maps at the 1200, 2400, and 3600 second marks to analyze the data and find commonalities in the data.  For the 1200 second dataset, I found that the areas in vicinity target line 2 (with 6 instances of orange/red coloration) and target line 3 (with 4 instances of orange/red coloration) had the greatest density.  For the 2400 second dataset, I found that the area in vicinity of target line 7 had the most density (10 instances of orange/red coloration) and target line 2 had significant density as well (9 instances of orange/red coloration).  For the 3600 second dtaaset, I found that
target line 7 again had the most density (8 instances of red/orange coloration) and that target line 2 had significant density as well (5 instances of red/orange coloration).  

Taking this data, the areas of highest pedestrian density based off the heat maps are the target line 2, target line 3, and target line 7 (see screenshot below).  Through this data, we can predict where people will be at a certain time given the initial conditions, and also potentially reconstruct the maze (i.e., potentially wider walls in the areas to facilitate traffic flow and lessen density).  This data is also useful in the event of an emergency, as we can focus our efforts on sending emergency personnel to the areas of highest density, and essentially create an algorithm to save the maximum number of lives.

~~~
ANALYSIS - Traffic Intensity Timeplots
I also coalated the data for the intensity timeplots.  In 80% of the samples, the yellow, red, and green target lines (target lines 2, 1, and 3) consistently displayed the highest traffic intensity over time (see screenshots below).  

This data could also be used in an algorithm to predict where pedestrians will be given a certain time, and also could be used to assist emergency personnel in the event of an evacuation.  This could also be used to predict wear/tear on the maze itself, and potentially be utilized to construct a maintenance schedule.

~~~
ANALYSIS - Traffic Timeplot
Similar to the intensity timeplots, I also coalated the data for the traffic timeplots.  In the majority of the data, target line 2 was the most prominent throughout the hour long simulation, which makes sense because the agents will continue to flow through the first part of the maze.  Also, the maze was set up to have equal probabilities after each wrong path decision, and this juncture in the maze represents a path to other wrong paths within the first ped select node.  Additionally, I observed that as time goes on, target line 7 (later in the maze) becomes more prominent in the data, which again makes sense due to the flow of the agents over time.  Other commonalities between the charts indicated that target line 1 and target line 3 experienced high volumes of traffic that generally maintained levels throughout the simulation, but did decrease over time (see screenshots below).

~~~
CONCLUSION/FINAL ANALYSIS
This data, used in concert with the data above, is simply another way for the maze operators to predict where people will be, and at what roughly what time they will be there.  This can again be used for maintenance purposes and emergency situations.  Based on the intensity, density, and traffic data, the areas that management should focus on are the areas in vicinity of target lines 2, 3, 7 (see screenshot below).

Additionally, one of the other big takeaways from this was the average (mean) total number of agents/customers that made it through the maze after ten simulations, which I calculated to be 244.7 agents will finish the maze within an hour (summed each trial (263, 248, 222, 254, 248, 239, 261, 242, 238, 232) and then divided by 10), and that 290.3 will enter the maze within an hour (summed each trial (317, 295, 274, 299, 292, 287, 300, 292, 276, 271) and then divided by 10).  This number could be used to calculate the number of employees needed to properly man the amusement park, and could also be used to project customer throughput/flow through the maze.

## Managment Overall Focus

~~~
PARAMETER CHANGE 1 & ANALYSIS
To change the parameters, I varied the initial speed of .3 to .7 meters per second (uniformly distributed) to 1 to 1.25 meters per second, as I feel that in the beginning of the maze the rate would be increased due to lack of path choices for this specific maze; I then decreased the comfortable rate from 1 to 2 meters per second (uniformly distributed) to .5 to 1 meter per second, with consideration that the maze operators might want to decrease the light levels from medium to low, thus increasing the difficulty of the maze.

-After changing this parameter, it is apparent that the density graph has more intensity throughout the simulation, and it also appears that the T2L is not as prominently featured in regards to traffic/intensity (see screenshot below), and that there is much more skew towards the latter parts of the maze, specifically around target line 7 and the hall adjacent to target line 8, and area near target line 9/10 (see screenshot).  The intensity/traffic timeplots below mirror these observations.  This illustrates that by simply changing the parameters in how the agents move, that there could potentially be a different maintenance focus and different evacuation procedures/protocol depending on the accuracy of both models.

~~~
PARAMETER CHANGE 2 & ANALYSIS
Additionally, with  I added groups within the simulation as often times many people will go to social activities such as this with friends (initial conditions for group as follows: put a group size between 1-2 with uniform discreet distribution, set the interarrival time to within 1 second to simulate group arriving together, and put the group formation as front, as there is often one person leading the group).
-After trying this, at approximately 362 seconds into the simulation, there began to form pockets of agents that would group, presumably stuck in various locations in the maze; this indicates that the maze was not constructed for large groups, and that potentially the creators of the maze should consider widening the walls to avoid potential fire hazard/emergency evacuation issues.  Another solution is to have an attendant simply spacing individuals approximately 10-15 seconds apart to decrease the occurrence of traffic jams.  Bottom line, this simuation has identified a problem that if caught during the design/development phase, could ultimately save the maze operators a significant amount of money.

**(c) - 30 points**: Model and analyze a building (or floor/outdoor space/stadium) on campus. (There is help on piazza how to find rough building plans - we expect something plausible). Create a senario: evacuation, daily office routine, special event, normal egress.... etc., and model and design your own experiment to determine if the building design suits the needs of its users. Start with photographs of your site, describe your site, describe your senario and hypothesis. Then use an agent-based pedistrian simulation to visualize your experiment's results.

~~~
CONSTRUCTION/INITIAL CONDITIONS/FIRE EVACUATION SCENARIO
ANS: I first obtained digital photgraphs of the floor plan of the Partnership II's first floor.  I also walked through the first floor and the perimeter of the building to confirm all office locations/exits.  I then imported the image files to AnyLogic, and began to trace the floor plan.

After creating the floor plan for the first floor, I then demarcated different areas where people will be working based on number of offices and generally anecdotal observations during my time at UCF, and set the probability equally for agents using a pedSelect node with equal distributions of the agents going to one of five areas (see screenshot).  I also emplaced attractors in the area to ensure that the agents would go in the vicinity of the areas of higher pedestrian traffic.

For the initial conditions, I left the agents at default speeds (.5 to 1 uniformly distributed for comfotable speed, and .3 to .7 uniformly distributed for initial speed), placed the number of arrivals at 10 per minute, and limited the arrivals to 60 (again, based on anecdotal evidence on how many people I have seen in the first floor during visits).  There will be 60 agents at the time of the scenario start, with no additional agents arriving during the evacuation.

My scenario revolves around an early morning fire that begins in the robotics lab; as such this exit will be blocked, and agents will have to utilize exits to make it to designated safe zones, which I designated all personnel in areas 1, 3, and 4 to utilize Safe Area 1, and those agents working in area 2 to utilize Safe Area 2 (assume both are 400' away as specified by the UCF Fireplan, see references).  The fire will begin (and simultaneously a fire alarm will sound) at 10 minutes in model time (I created an event utilized the free function to send the agents to the safe aeras; Keith helped me with calling function, see references below).  I have inputted ped flow statistics throughout the building and in front of every exit to measure the flow, traffic, intensity, and density of the simulation (see screenshot below).

Although the UCF Fire Plan states that less than 5-10 minutes would be rated excellent for a fire drill (a "prompt and orderly evacuation"), in an actual fire depending on a multitude of variables, smoke inhalation can quickly incapacitate individuals within a few minutes (Kulig, 2008).  Therefore, in the effort to measure a worst case scenario, I will assume the fire is extremely deadly and  will measure exit rates at 2, 3, and 4 minutes (+/- 5 seconds) after the fire alarm sounds and assume that any agents left within the building after the 4 minute mark will be casualties that must be attended to by emergency personnel.

~~~
ANALYSIS
I took screenshots of the pedestrian traffic at approximately 595 seconds, 720 seconds, 780 seconds, and 840 seconds, and ran the simulation ten times (+/- 5 seconds for each screenshot).  I also captured data via traffic and intensity timeplots (1 sample per second for 900 samples for all ped statistcs as indicated in the model above; due to the nature of the scenario, I stopped collecting data after the 15 minute mark in model time (or 5 minutes after the evacuation)).  Please see the screenshots below for each separate dataset.  These datasets are followed by coalated datasets of each density map, and both intensity and traffic plots.
